# Notes
Notes for classes I take, can be any class/book I read, just want a place to keep them.

## Tools Used
I use LibreOffice Writer now for writing out notes, with a latex and html plugin to support multiple different formats.

## Notes Available
My approach to notes is to follow some sort of structured course/textbook, and
then try to distill every subject into a set of topics, and try to explain them
in my own words. 

No notes section is truly complete but here are the Note sections I have right
now:

### Machine Learning
This Machine Learning course is largely based on the Udacity Intro To Machine
Learning Nanodegree, but I felt like that course wasn't sufficient to get
a really good idea of what the subject is about, so I intend to supplement this
with some other resources.

### Algorithms
This Algorithms course follows a basic undergraduate algorithms course from
MIT. It will include my attempt at the homeworks (emphasis on attempt I'm
terrible at proving things)

### General Relativity
This General Relativity course will follow the Hartle book.

## Topics To do in the future

I'm starting Graduate School soon, so I hope to have notes for each class
I take there. Other than those classes, I'd like to do something on:

- Undergraduate Applied Mathematics (following Math Methods for Physicists and
Engineers)

- Quantum Physics

- Quantum Computing

- How to Prove Things

- Undergrad CS topics

- Circuits

- Theoretical Mechanics

- Electrodynamics

- ... The list goes on for a while

I would also like to include some social science topics but I don't have a good
way of distilling them in the same way I can do STEM topics. I'll probably
start with U.S history and figure it out, but I don't have a good way about
doing it.

## Help
If you would like to help out with these notes, please contact me, just so
I know what's going on, and can direct you to the tools I use to make
multi-format notes.
