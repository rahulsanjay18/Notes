    \section{1-1}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $f_1, f_2, f_4, f_3$ The ordering of the last two are obvious, for 2 versus 1, take note that $O(n) = log(n)$ I got this one wrong because I did not realize this. L'Hopital's Rule \href{https://www.mathwarehouse.com/calculus/derivatives/when-Lhopitals-rule-fail.php}{does not work here}
            \item $f_1, f_4, f_3, f_2$ The thing to note here is to write out the combination as a polynomial of $n^2$
            \item $f_4, f_1, f_3, f_2$ The thing to note here is that $n^{\sqrt{n}} = 2^{\sqrt{n}log(n)}$
        \end{enumerate}

    \section{1-2}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item To do this, we can write out the expansion, eliminating the $T(\frac{x}{2}, \frac{y}{2})$ from the recurrence:\\
            $T(x, y) = \Theta(x+y) + \Theta(\frac{x+y}{2}) + \Theta(\frac{x+y}{4}) + \Theta(\frac{x+y}{8}) + ...$\\
            This converges to $O(n)$
            \item Again, writing this out,\\ $T(x, y) = \Theta(x) + \Theta(x) + ... $ until $y \rightarrow 0$ so we can conclude that the answer is $nlog(n)$
            \item Rewrite $T(x, y) = \Theta(x) + \Theta(\frac{y}{2}) + T(\frac{x/2, y})$, which follows the same logic and conclusion as 1.
        \end{enumerate}
    \section{1-3}
    %I kind of understand this but idk how much I get it.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item correct. divide and conquer
            \item correct. naive search/greedy alg
            \item incorrect. at the bottom of the function, we can see that it constricts the new iteration to the smaller subproblem (one quadrant of the previous problem), which does not take into account the fact that a peak might be on a different, adjacent quadrant. It needs to check at every iteration if the best seen value is the greatest value
            \item correct, same as number 3 but this time we take turns splitting between rows and columns, and when we get our max on the dividing line, we compare it to our best seen cooridinates to confirm if we have a peak
        \end{enumerate}
