California v. Greenwood (1988)

- Police searched garbage for evidence for a crime, SCOTUS ruled that it was not a violation of the 4th Amendment
- Notably, in NJ, State v. Hempele (1990) ruled the opposite

Scott v. Sanford (1857)

- Slave Dred Scott claimed that he was free because he resided in Illinois and Wisconsin (free states) prior to returning to Missouri

Marbury v. Madison (1803)

- Adams and the federalists controlled congress from 1796 to 1800
- Election of 1800 elected Jefferson, a Dem-Repub
- To maintain power, the federalists

  - nominated John Marshall to chief justice
  - increase lower fed judges
  - decrease SCOTUS members (so D-Rs cant fill a
    vacancy)
  - make 42 new justices of the peace
- Critically, Adams also appointed multiple judges on the last night of his term, and a few of those commissions were not delivered that night and were withheld by Jefferson
- One of these was William Marbury, who sued for
  commission
- Justice Marshall decided that

  - Marbury’s appointment was confirmed when the seal was affixed to the letter
- The remedy to this was a writ of mandamus
- But SCOTUS was not the place to enforce this, and the Judiciary Act overstepped Article III of the Constitution
- This established judicial review, the idea that
  it is the court’s job to interpret the constitution, as it is the fundamental
  law of the land

Fletcher v Peck (1810)

- In 1795, the Georgia state legislature passed a land grant awarding territory to four companies. The following year, the legislature voided the law and declared all rights and claims under it to be invalid. In 1800, John Peck acquired land that was part of the original legislative grant. He then sold the land to Robert Fletcher three years later claiming that the land sales had been legitimate. Fletcher argued that since the original sale of the land had been declared invalid, Peck had no legal right to sell the land and thus committed a breach of contract.
- Could the contract between Fletcher and Peck be invalidated by an act of the Georgia legislature?
- The legislature’s repeal of the law was unconstitutional under Article I, Section 10, Clause I (the Contract Clause) of the United States Constitution. The majority concluded the sale between Fletcher and Peck was a binding contract, which under the Contract Clause cannot be invalidated even if it is illegally secured.

Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee (1816)

- During the American Revolution, Virginia created laws allowing the state to seize property of Loyalists. In 1781, Denny Martin,a British subject, inherited land from his uncle, a Loyalist. The following year, the Virginia legislature voided the land grant and transferred the land back to Virginia. Virginia granted a portion of this land to David Hunter. A federal treaty dictated that Lord Fairfax was entitled to the property.
- The Virginia Supreme Court upheld Virginia's law permitting the confiscation of property, even though it conflicted with the federal treaty. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed and remanded, holding that the treaty superseded state law under the Supremacy Clause of Article VI. On remand, the Virginia Court of Appeals declined to follow the ruling and argued that the law granting the Supreme Court appellate review over state court decisions, section 25 of the Judiciary Act (the Act), was unconstitutional.
- Is Section 25 of the Judiciary Act, which grants the U.S. Supreme Court appellate review over state court cases involving federal law, unconstitutional?
- No. Article VI of the US Constitution (the Supremacy Clause), combined with the grant of appellate jurisdiction in Article III, gives federal courts the power to review state court decisions that interpret federal law or the Constitution.
- The Court rejected the claim that Virginia and the national government were equal sovereigns. Relying on the Supremacy Clause, Justice Story held that federal interpretations of federal law should supersede state interpretations. He reasoned that there should be uniform and predictable outcomes across all states.

Gibbons v. Ogden (1821)

- Ogden was franchised part of a steamboat monopoly in NY
- Gibbons began operating a competing steamboat line between NJ and NY and Ogden sued for infringing on the franchise
- Marshall ruled in favor of Gibbons because an act of congress conflicted with the grant of monopoly
- More importantly, he said that the commerce clause implied that commerce between states includes traffic and intercourse between states and must be measured by the effect the commerce has on other states, even if the actual commerce happens within a state.
- Regulation of this can therefore be done by Congress because though Ogden’s business operated solely in NY, it impacted Gibbon’s business

United States v. E.C Knight (1895)

- American Sugar Refining Company had a monopoly of the sugar industry, with 90% of the country's production
- Taken to court over the Sherman Antitrust Act
- Court sided with Knight, saying that the monopoly was of manufacturing, not commerce so it cannot be regulated in the same way
- Partial overturn of Gibbons v. Ogden

Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States (1935)

- Court struck down the central part of the New Deal, the National Industrial Recovery Act

Wickard v. Filburn (1942)

- Filburn grew over his wheat allotment with the intent to use the wheat for himself, and the Dept. of Agriculture fined him
- Court sided with Wickard because if Filburn grew his own wheat for consumption, he would not buy it on the market, which is fine if he is the only one, but if it was done on a larger scale with more farmers, this will hurt the national market and therefore interstate commerce

- SCOTUS decided against the government

National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012)
- Dispute was over the "individual mandate" provision of Obama's Affordable Care Act
- the conservatives thought it impacted the commerce clause because the ACA prevented companies from denying coverage, which could encourage people to wait till they are sick to get insurance, increasing cost for everyoone
- So it was struck down
- It was within taxing power of the government, so you can tax people without insurance but can't compel companies in the same way
